  BackgroundText: "\rYou mind has started to falter. Falling apart like your flesh
    did centuries ago. As a powerful lich, the thought of the final death is unacceptable.
    \n\nA whisper in your empty skull tells you the mighty Demon Konallath holds
    the key to your immortality. You must hunt him down and squeeze his secrets out
    of him, before you perish."
